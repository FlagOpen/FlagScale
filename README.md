## About

[FlagScale](https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagScale.git) is a comprehensive toolkit designed to support the entire lifecycle of large models, developed with the backing of the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence (BAAI). It builds on the strengths of several prominent open-source projects, including [Megatron-LM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM) and [vllm](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm), to provide a robust, end-to-end solution for managing and scaling large models.

The primary objective of FlagScale is to enable seamless scalability across diverse hardware architectures while maximizing computational resource efficiency and enhancing model performance. By offering essential components for model development, training, and deployment, FlagScale seeks to establish itself as an indispensable toolkit for optimizing both the speed and effectiveness of large model workflows.

FlagScale is also a part of [FlagAI-Open](https://flagopen.baai.ac.cn/), an open-source initiative by BAAI that aims to foster an open-source ecosystem for AI technologies. It serves as a platform where developers, researchers, and AI enthusiasts can collaborate on various AI projects, contribute to the development of cutting-edge AI solutions, and share their work with the global community.

## Quick Start

FlagScale leverages [Hydra](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hydra) for configuration management. The configurations are organized into two levels: an outer experiment-level YAML file and an inner task-level YAML file.

- The experiment-level YAML file defines the experiment directory, backend engine, task type, and other related environmental configurations.
- The task-level YAML file specifies the model, dataset, and parameters for specific tasks such as training or inference.

All valid configurations in the task-level YAML file correspond to the arguments used in backend engines such as Megatron-LM and vllm, with hyphens (-) replaced by underscores (_). For a complete list of available configurations, please refer to the backend engine documentation. Simply copy and modify the existing YAML files in the [examples](./examples) folder to get started.

### Setup
We recommend using the latest release of [NGC's PyTorch container](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/pytorch) for setup.

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagScale.git
    ```

2. Install the requirements:
    ```sh
    cd FlagScale
    ./install/install-requirements.sh --env train
    ./install/install-requirements.sh --env inference
    ```
    The above instructions create two conda environments: `flagscale-train` and `flagscale-inference`, which contain the dependency environments for training and inference, respectively.

    The llama.cpp backend (CPU by default) is alternative, for example:
    ```sh
    ./install/install-requirements.sh --env inference --llama-cpp-backend cuda
    ```

3. Unpatch the backend code adaptation of FlagScale as needed
    ```
    cd FlagScale
    python tools/patch/unpatch.py --backend Megatron-LM
    python tools/patch/unpatch.py --backend vllm
    ```

4. Install the packages with customized extensions:
    ```sh
    cd FlagScale/third_party/vllm
    pip install .

    cd FlagScale
    python tools/patch/unpatch.py --backend Megatron-Energon
    cd third_party/Megatron-Energon
    pip install -e .
    cd FlagScale
    cp -r third_party/Megatron-Energon/src/megatron/energon third_party/Megatron-LM/megatron
    ```

5. Patch the modifications to the specified third_party backend for PR.
    ```
    cd FlagScale
    python tools/patch/patch.py --backend Megatron-LM
    python tools/patch/patch.py --backend vllm
    ```

### Run a Task

FlagScale provides a unified runner for various tasks, including training，inference and serve. Simply specify the configuration file to run the task with a single command. The runner will automatically load the configurations and execute the task. The following example demonstrates how to run a distributed training task.

#### Train

1. Start the distributed training job:
    ```sh
    python run.py --config-path ./examples/aquila/conf --config-name train action=run
    ```
    The `data_path` in the demo is the path of the training datasets following the [Megatron-LM format](./megatron/README.md#data-preprocessing). For quickly running the pretraining process, we also provide a small processed data ([bin](https://model.ks3-cn-beijing.ksyuncs.com/nlpdata/pile_wikipedia_demo.bin) and [idx](https://model.ks3-cn-beijing.ksyuncs.com/nlpdata/pile_wikipedia_demo.idx)) from the [Pile](https://pile.eleuther.ai/) dataset.

2. Stop the distributed training job:
    ```sh
    python run.py --config-path ./examples/aquila/conf --config-name train action=stop
    ```

#### Serve

1. Start the server:
    ```sh
    python run.py --config-path ./examples/qwen/conf --config-name serve action=run
    ```
2. Stop the server:
    ```sh
    python run.py --config-path ./examples/qwen/conf --config-name serve action=stop
    ```
For more details, please refer to [Quick Start](./flagscale/serve/README.md).

### DeepSeek-R1 Serving <a name="deepseek-r1-serving"></a>

We support the model serving of DeepSeek R1 and have implemented the `flagscale serve` command for one-click deployment. By configuring just two YAML files, you can easily serve the model using the `flagscale serve` command.

1. **Configure the YAML files:**
    ```
    FlagScale/
    ├── examples/
    │   └── deepseek_r1/
    │       └── conf/
    │           └── serve.yaml
    |           └── hostfile.txt # Set hostfile (optional)
    │           └── serve/
    │               └── 671b.yaml # Set model parameters and server port
    ```
    Note: When task covers multiple nodes, [hostfile.txt](./examples/deepseek/conf/hostfile.txt) is required. The file path should be set in serve.yaml.

2. **Install FlagScale CLI:**
    ```sh
    cd FlagScale
    PYTHONPATH=./:$PYTHONPATH pip install . --verbose --no-build-isolation
    ```

3. **One-click serve:**
    ```sh
    flagscale serve deepseek_r1
    ```

4. **Custom service parameters:**
    ```sh
    flagscale serve <MODEL_NAME> <MODEL_CONFIG_YAML>
    ```

The configuration files allow you to specify the necessary parameters and settings for your deployment, ensuring a smooth and efficient serving process.
